## Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems: Two Sides of the Same Coin
> Here, in this Research survey paper, we will learn **RS techniques** and draw commonalities between **IR and RS**, and try to adapt and leverage different IR models to RS

# Abstract

IR deals with the study of **information retrieval** techniques based on the inputs given by the user. There is another field called IF, which also revolves around information processing and presents with information to the user which may be of interest to them. One of the widely used IF techniques is the Recommender Systems which provides personalized suggestions to users based on their interests. If we broadly look at IR and IF (RS), both are quite similar in processing the vast available information and share the most relevant ones based on various retrieval techniques.
